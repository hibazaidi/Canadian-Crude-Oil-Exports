This project examines throughput and capacity trends for major Canadian pipelines, utilizing data from the Canada Energy Regulator (CER). The assignment includes data processing in R and visualizations for three pipelines: Enbridge Mainline, Trans Mountain, and TCPL Mainline.

### Enbridge Mainline Throughput by Product
